As a minimum specification, it is recommended that you do it with a more up-to-date CPU and a minimum of 8GB.

If you're using Windows, you need to install WSL or rent a Linux server.

There are two options for installing WSL. First, you can search for the latest Ubuntu on the Microsoft Store and install it on your computer or you can open CMD and install it manually

## **Installing WSL**

```bash
wsl --install
```

After WSL is successfully installed on your computer  we need set a username and password.

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```
